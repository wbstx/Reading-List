# Hand Pose Estimation
Hand pose estimation is a traditional area but still challenging.  Early works focus on depth-based or RGBD-based methods. Now some RGB-based methods are introduced.
Challenges to overcome:
+ Self-occlusion on hands 
+ Ambiguities
+ Real-time speed
## 3D Hand Pose Estimation
### RGB-based Method
[Exploiting Spatial-temporal Relationships for 3D Pose Estimation via Graph Convolutional Networks][1] using GCN for spatial-temporal coherence.
Insights:
+ GCN
+ spatio-temporal coherence
